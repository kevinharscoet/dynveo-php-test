    <h1>Welcome to our PHP Test</h1>
    <p>In the test, you will work on developing more features for a very simple blog website (like WordPress).</p>
    <p>A lot of the work has been done for you and provides a good example of the structure and methodology you should
        use when writing your own code.</p>
    <p>Please write the best code that you can. Write object-orientated PHP with good comments to explain your code;
        valid HTML; browser compliant CSS.</p>
    <p>Below, you will find the 4 features; please develop as many features as you can during the time you have
        available. Please remember that it is better to finish a feature completely before proceeding to the next
        feature - quality of work with thorough testing and feedback to the user is the most important thing.</p>
    <h2>Feature 1</h2>
    <p>When registering a new user, check if the user exists already.</p>
    <p>Validate the users email address and show a message to the user if this problem occurs.</p>
    <h2>Feature 2</h2>
    <p>Add pagination to the blog page.</p>
    <p>As you would normally find on a WordPress site, add pagination after 5 blog posts.</p>
    <h2>Feature 3</h2>
    <p>Allow users to edit their own blog posts.</p>
    <p>Again, as is normal on WordPress, a user should be able to edit their own (not other users) blog posts.</p>
    <h2>Feature 4</h2>
    <p>Allow a featured image to be added to a blog post.</p>
    <p>When adding or editing a blog post, allow a featured image to be uploaded and also show this image when the blog
        post is displayed.</p>
    <h2>Bonus points!</h2>
    <p>Bonus points if you have time:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled">
        <li>Using NPM and/or Composer</li>
        <li>Using Gulp/Grunt to compile SASS/LESS to create minified CSS</li>
        <li>Improving the design/style of the website</li>
    </ul>
